<h2> Theme - The use of algorithms and programming in everyday tasks</h2>
<h2>base text: </h2>
There are simple applications that we can develop and that help a lot in our daily lives. It is a big question when we are going to supply a vehicle to know which fuel is more advantageous: alcohol or gasoline. The consumption ratio between alcohol and gasoline is 70%, that is, if we have the same volume of fuel, the energy generated by 70% of gasoline consumption is the same as 100% of alcohol consumption. Having this information, we are able to know, when filling up, which fuel is the most advantageous, dividing the price of alcohol by the price of gasoline.
<br>
- If this value is more than 0.7, it is worth gasoline.
<br>
- If this value is less than 0.7, alcohol is worth it.
<br>
- If the value is exactly 0.7, it doesn't matter if you fill up with one or the other.
<h2>statement:</h2>
Considering your knowledge and the explanations above, write a JavaScript program:<br>
A) that receives as input the price of gasoline and the price of alcohol and
inform the user which is the most advantageous fuel (or if it doesn't matter
supply any one of them).
<br>
B) Consider that afterwards, the program must ask the user if he wants to
perform a new calculation: if the user confirms that yes, the program
asks for the inputs again. Otherwise, the program is terminated.
